Just Balloons is my first creative project using code. I used C++ in OpenFrameworks to create a simple forloop and used math to create this visualization. You can see the final results in the file named 'Just Balloons.mov' and if you like it, I highly recommend using my project files to try and create something new in OpenFrameworks.
